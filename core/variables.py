"""Handling and storage of data in Nyles.

This module contains the essential classes for data handling in Nyles.
The most fundamental type is a scalar field living in 3D space and
representing a physical quantity.  It is modelled by the class Scalar,
which stores the discretization of the field in 3D numpy arrays.
A vector field represents a physical quantity with three components and
is modelled by objects of the class Vector.  Each component of the vector
is a scalar field.  The scalars and vectors of Nyles are managed by an
instance of the class State.

Variables in the LES model can be characterised by the way they appear
in the equations:
 - A prognostic variable is a variable, of which the time derivative
   appears explicitly in the equations, for example buoyancy and
   covariant velocity;
 - A diagnostic variable is a variable, of which the time derivative
   does not appear explicitly in the equations; it cannot be integrated
   in time, so its development must be calculated differently.

    The data of the scalar field can be accessed via the "view"-methods,
    which return a 3D array.  For performance reasons, the data is
    internally saved three times in three arrays.

    Attributes:
     - param: dictionary describing the properties of the 3D space in
        which the scalar field lives, i.e., its size, the number of
        points in the halo and the neighbours
     - name: a common name describing the physical quantity represented
        by the scalar
     - nickname: a short name or a symbol for the physical quantity
     - dimension: the physical dimension of the quantity
     - prognostic: a Boolean variable to distinguish prognostic from
        diagnostic variables
     - data: dictionary with keys ['i', 'j', 'k']; each key points to a
        3D array which represents the discretization of the scalar
        field; the array is orientated, such that its key is the inner
        direction; note that the shapes of the arrays can differ;
